        "Big Data is a very popular field for professionals these days. However, multinational competitors have a different perspective on how the subject is to be taught. According to the new approaches, It is kept in mind that  we should teach CDO principles. Data analytics lifecycle must be kept in mind while teaching. Big Data technologies should be taught along with Model Building techniques. It is recommended to incorporate research methods in data analysis along with teaching small data analytics. Students must be provided with real-world project experience.  "
